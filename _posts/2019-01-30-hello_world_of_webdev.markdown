   So I've done a lot of different jobs. I used to bus tables at Red Lobster, hated it. I enlisted in the Army as a Special Forces canditate, I hated it. I even tried selling insurance, and guess what? I HATED IT. I went to the University of South Carolina to start a career in medicine, and ended up leaving senior year because as you can imagine, I hated it. Luckily, I got a management position at a nightclub....and I LOVED IT. But not for the reasons you're probably thinking.

   I started at the nightclub the day after the previous manager was fired and was told the job was mine right on the spot. All I could think of was..I have no idea how to do this. But, I went home that night and made plans...and plans...and more plans on how to increase profits and decrease expenses. I made P & L statements and tracked all our suppliers to get better deals. Before I knew it, the place began running smoothly. I became addicted to improving the business model and making everything simpler and more efficient. A year down the road I turned in my end of year P & L, and my boss looked at me aghast. We had doubled our net income in the one year I'd been there compared to the last ten years of operation.



  AND THAT'S WHY I LOVE CODING. I realized after I left the nightclub that that's what I really loved about it, was making efficient plans (or programs) and fixing problems. When I left my job I didn't really know what I wanted to do, I tried a little of everything.  I just knew that I wanted something to do with creating things and problem solving and I didn't have the funds or time to go back to college. Magically I stumbled upon coding as I was looking for jobs. There were SO MANY jobs in my area for webdevs....and they paid GREAT. I didn't want to do it solely for the money, so I thought I'd try some free resources online first.

  I found my way to Flatiron University as one of the best free resources. I started slowly, but once I did I never stopped and looked back. It was like a drug, creating and developing something that could act autonomously. I'd never felt like that about anything else. But....I didn't apply, I saw the acceptance rate was a mere 5% and knew without any experience I didn't have a chance at getting in. 


  I kept applying to other jobs and working odd ones to make money and I got a call one day. A guy from Flatiron talked to me for almost 20min. He never tried to sell me, convince me, or fool me. He motivated me and told me if that's really how I felt, please to apply. That guy changed my life. I'm still surprised I got accepted and that they took a chance on some guy that had no coding experience. But ever since, I've done nothing but code. I think about it, dream about it, and live it. If that's not magical, I don't know what is.
