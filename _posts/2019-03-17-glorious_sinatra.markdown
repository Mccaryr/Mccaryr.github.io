This project we were told to focus on building a web application that had a content managment system. Finally, we were able to wrap up all that we learned about databases, models, and controllers to build something amazing and functional. I  decided to build a videogame organizer. I spent the majority of the time working on the user accessibility. The biggest issues I had were making sure that the users information had persisted. Somehow the sessions weren't carrying over until I remembered to set the session_secret! Overall, the project was extremely enlightening to how the MVC works alongside user authentication. And I even got a little experience with css properties! If you want to organize your videogames or your just curious here's my project https://github.com/Mccaryr/Sinatra-VideogameTracker-Project
