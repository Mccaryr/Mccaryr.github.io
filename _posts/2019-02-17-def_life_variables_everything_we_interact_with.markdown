   Most people never think about life programatically, but it's easy to see the correlations if you try. Methods are a formula to solve a problem. We can think of them in terms of a recipe or a blueprint. a way to create or build somethg as well as executing it. Whether that is a cake or a house we use methods unconciously all the time. In a recipe there is a list of items that are described that must be added to create your dish. We can think of those listed items as variables. Variables represent things that we want to interact with to create something. These variables are a tangible way to grab or group anything together like a dozen eggs or just one.
