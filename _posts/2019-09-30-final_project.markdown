This final project left me with a whole new appreciation for full-stack developers. In this project I built a weather app with a React/Redux front-end and a Rails back-end. Everything I learned from the Flatiron curriculum was utilized to make a complete product. While I learned a lot, I also ran into a hundred different issues, first with completing my knowledge base of Redux as well as experimenting with Thunk and React Router.  The skill I worked on the most was troubleshooting, I often got stuck but with great troubleshooters like debugger and pry the project became infinitely easier. My weather app had a form that took in a city and country and could return the temperature and humidity of the current weather. It also simultaneously saved the location to the database that I can use later. I think the main focus of this project is to set up your app so that it can be easily expanded. Overall, I enjoyed this project and learned a great deal from it. My project is here if you'd like to check out a Weather App built with React/Redux and Rails.
