Whew, it's tough to say where to start on this project. It's basically a culmination of everything I'd learned so far about ruby and it truly tested me in more ways than I expected. I started this project thinking I would spend the majority of time debugging and figuring out errors since I hadn't written any tests to correct myself and had to go on trial and error. I was sooo wrong. I actually spent the majority of time learning about gems and local environments and the hosts of issues that come along with that.

My first issue I ran across was the sandbox that was provided to us truly did not like me for some reason and constantly deleted my work. At the time I didn't really know any other way so I kept trying to code and save as fast as possible. Let's just say I got about 5 lines of code done in 2 days. Fortunately my tech coach helped out and showed me a local environment that I could download and play around with.

Downloading the local environment and setting up gems and environment taught me a lot about how to set things up and how so many of our files are connected along with how they execute. I learned more about dependencies and A LOT more about scraping. My next hurdle was iterating through scraping and figuring out how to grab EXACTLY what I wanted and how to make a method that could be called in my other file. Suffice to say, it was a lot of aggravation and hair pulling. But, I learned more through this project than anything so far, it tested me in different ways than I expected and forced me to solve issues that'll definitely happen in real world scenarios. 

Basically, my CLI presents the user with 100 greatest movies as ranked by imdb. They can choose the corresponding number to get details on that movie. Here's a link if you'd like to check it out! https://github.com/Mccaryr/greatest-movies
