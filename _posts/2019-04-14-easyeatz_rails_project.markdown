Going on week 13 at Flatiron School of Programming Awesomeness. This week we had our most difficult project yet. Our Rails project was required to have validations, 3rd party authentication, scope methods, many-to-many relationships and much more. When I was first trying to decide on what to do I thought about the simplest and easiest ways to accomplish this project. The ones I've made in the past merely checked all the requirements off but I felt as if I was only reiterating what I had already learned without learning many new subjects. This project I stretched  much further and challenged myself. I created a food delivery app similar to UberEats but styled it as if the website hosts made all their own food and distributed it. First off, I've always taken for granted how much goes into a web app, especially one with a cart. This was my first time dealing with these kinds of many-to-many associations along with all the math that comes with calculating an accurate total. I spent at least a full day working on the facebook authentication. Although I ran through many challenges, this was the most fun and entertaining project I've worked on thus far. I finally felt like a real web developer troubleshooting multipe issues and I finally got into the rhythm of css styling as well as embedding videos. This project was at times difficult and frustrating, but I feel much more confident and accomplished in my coding skills. My advice to anyone reading is to challenge and stretch yourself to find your limits and then you'll grow much faster as a developer. Godspeed friends!
